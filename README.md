# Lab Task 08 – Flip-Flops & Counters  
**Course:** Computer Architecture  
**Tool Used:** Logisim  

---

## Overview  
This lab demonstrates the design and simulation of fundamental sequential circuits including flip-flops, counters, and registers. The goal is to understand how data is stored, toggled, and shifted in digital systems using Logisim.

## 🛠️ How to Use  
1. Open any `.circ` file using **Logisim**.  
2. Use the clock input to simulate the circuit.  
3. Observe output changes based on inputs and clock pulses.

## Key Concepts  
- Flip-Flops: D, T, SR, JK  
- Counters: Synchronous & Asynchronous  
- Registers: Data Storage & Shift Operations
